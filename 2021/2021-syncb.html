            Early sociologists reflected that our society was a self-contained and self-regulating 
            semiotic system whose elements or actors are defined by relationships with other elements 
            within that system. To them, the structure of the network they lived in (at the beginning 
            of the industrial revolution) was imposed by the same actors participating in that system. 
            Limitations that essentially made them cogs in the wheel of industrialization and 
            densification. However, within this fate lies moments of synchrony and of the harmonious, 
            along with the dynamic.
            My intentions for a future truck stop is in the celebration of the progressive diachrony 
            found in human made machines and tangentially, in the way those machines interact with 
            human actors to make our world run the way it might tomorrow.<br><br>
            We began this semester looking into both an anachronic vision of America’s past, littered 
            throughout the nation, paired with an analysis of how today’s gas stations and truck stops 
            work. Looking deeper into the machinations of the pumps, the levers, the shops and the 
            interactivity, I understood the gas station today as a vernacular consistent throughout 
            the nation. The tectonics and the instruments are the same, a product inherent to our mass 
            manufacturing and industrialized market. Those principles are found within the powerful 
            machines that pull the trailers and allow for cross-country shipments.
            The gears and pistons that revolutionized the 20th century work in a rhythmic tempo, an 
            unending procession of progress from point A to B. I was incredibly impressed by the diesel 
            engine, and through drawing it in diagram, found this mathematic of parts that act in tandem 
            within the overall machine. <br><br>
            Now transitioning to our site, the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. The only access points to the 
            main highway I-80 are two interchanges spread about 4 miles apart. With the development of an 
            increasing number of warehouses and manufacturing plants in this industrial center, the 
            congestion becomes increasingly severe along those bottlenecks.
            So it’s this main interchange that I believe can be a testing ground for a new prototype of the 
            truck stop.<br><br>
            The SYNC construct intends to be a 1500 ft long truck stop that is implanted onto the 
            continuum of the highway system. The construct forms a loop, with parking platforms spaced 
            along the central void where packages are transported from the industrial center through the 
            use of elevated maglev tracks.
            Trucks are expected to offload and load within this construct, which acts as both a nexus for the 
            warehouses beyond as well as the final destination for incoming trucks. The platforms elevate or 
            lower the trucks and the cargo onto 3 levels, a level for reloading, unloading, maintenance or 
            recharging. As the platforms rotate up and down, the shuttles ferry the goods directly to the 
            trailers. The platforms use a series of pulleys to move, and the modules in the center act as 
            counterweights for the platforms. As the modules move up and down, the individual units form an 
            iterative space that will differ at any moment in time as it moves in elevation.
            As the current infrastructure is already nearing max capacity, the SYNC construct is to be a new 
            prototype for a more efficient logistical system that can achieve levels of scale suitable for the 
            Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center.
            Ultimately, the construct is a machine that merges synchrony with procession, bridging the 
            structuralist impression of the static with the dynamism and rhythm found in the mechanics of our vast
            logistical networks.
