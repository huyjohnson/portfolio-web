          Living in Edinburgh exposed me to a balanced
          phenomenological identity within centuries of stacked environments.
          I called this place my home and grew accustomed to roaming the urban
          infrastructure. Sights, smells, and all items experiential gave me an
          ideal view of the living environment, and the city became my
          playground. I moved to the Denver suburbs, and my new friends found my
          childhood alien. Travelling with my parents meant by car, and <em>minutes
          became miles</em>. For the first time, I was a stranger to the city and
          lost my sense of place. <br><br>
          During my undergraduate development, the morphological coherence
          within Christopher Alexander’s pattern theory brought understanding to
          my childhood experiences while the communal design of Unite
          d’Habitation built half a century ago guided my thoughts on place. A
          harmony naturally existed between the people that formed to create
          the first settlements, yet presently this social congruity is
          severely affected through artificial segregation.

          The <strong>role of the
          built environment is to create intersections of community to
          maintain the human experience</strong>. While not necessarily intended to
          break down any barriers, the phenomena of place offer a return to an
          a priori sodality. I was inspired by the chaotic rush of
          construction underlaying much of China’s growth in the early 21st
          Century, yet the casual efficiency in which historic neighborhoods
          were demolished soured this rush to modernize. In developing under
          the centrally planned model of soviet-era modernity, many cities
          have lost the personal connections, the human scaled environments
          and the intimate communities. <br><br>

        <div class='about-box-text'>
          Rejecting the developments of the modern era, the offices I worked for
          followed an ethos closer to the historical Eastern philosophy of a
          natural harmony. The qualities of form speak more to an ontological
          debate on placemaking rather than an allusion to any natural
          landscape. The formal experiments produced by me and my peers belies a
          philosophical rebellion towards the urban ennui of the past
          century. Beijing offered me opportunities to discover the
          trappings of faulty planning and I began questioning the
          architect’s role in enabling this degradation of the urban
          environment. <br><br>
          Rather than stay a passive responder to an ecological
          crisis, I wish to foster a <strong>proactive and engaging</strong> architectural
          environment that offers solutions to problems yet unasked. The
          richness of historical exploration that can be found in our urban cities
          reminds me of my childhood adventures across Edinburgh. I am drawn to
          the sustainable initiatives undertaken by many leading cities today,
          and growing up within this tumultuous generation, I hold an acute
          awareness of the issues concerning urbanization and ecology. The
          era we live in demands solutions to yesterday's ecological problems and
          I believe architects can offer effective yet enriching methods to our
          built environment.
